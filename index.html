        <h1>IDS Enhanced Routing Rules Addon</h1>

<p>IDS server addon for enhanced routing rules.  This addon could easily serve as a template for any routing rule that you may want to schedule.  In addition, you could easily add other functionality (adding info to fields, generating emails, etc).</p>

<p><strong>Becareful with server addons!  To quote Uncle Ben:  "With great power comes great responsibility."<br>
If you've been creating client addons and want to try a new challenge, you may want to try server addons like this one.<br>
It is important to be in contact with whomever has access to your system manager logs when working with server addons.</strong></p>

<p><strong>This addon has not yet been approved by Atlas Systems.</strong></p>

<hr><h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>Most of these settings mirror the same settings you would use in Customization Manager to set up a new routing rule.</p>
